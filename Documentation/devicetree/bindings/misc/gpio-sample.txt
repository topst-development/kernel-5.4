Telechips GPIO Sample driver

Required properties:

- compatible : should be "gpio_sample".
- interrupt-parent : indicates interrupt parent of interrupt source.
- interrupts : describes interrupt source.
- gpios : describes GPIO used by GPIO sample driver for normal uses that include changing direction
and value of the GPIO.

    tcc_gpio_sample {
	compatible = "gpio_sample";
	leble = "TCC GPIO";
	interrupt-parent = <&gpa>;
	interrupts = <1 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_BOTH>;
	gpios = <&gpa 2 0>;
    };

*** OP-TEE OS Region Device Tree Bindings ***

Telechips OP-TEE OS is loaded in the middle of memory.
REE(Normal World) cannot use the corresponding area, so it should be set as
reserved memory.

Properties:
compatible (required) - should contain "optee.os"
reg (required) - standard definition
no-map (optional) - empty property
    - Indicates the operating system must not create a virtual mapping
      of the region as part of its standard mapping of system memory,
      nor permit speculative access to it under any circumstances other
      than under the control of the device driver using the region.
status (optional) - standard definition
    - bootloader can be set the status to "okay" when OPTEE OS is running
      even if the status is "disabled".

Example:
	reserved_memory: reserved-memory {
		    :
		reserved_optee: optee_os {
			compatible = "optee.os";
			reg = <0x0 0x2e000000 0x0 0x02000000>;
			no-map;
			status = "disabled";
		};
	};

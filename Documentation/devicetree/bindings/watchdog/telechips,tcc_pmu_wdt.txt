* Telechips Watchdog Timer for using PMU Watchdog.

The watchdog timer used for reset the Main processor on TCC in the event
of software malfunction. Watchdog on TCC Main processor use PMU Watchdog and
SMU Timer.

Required properties:
- compatible: Must be "telechips,wdt".
- reg: Physical base address of the watchdog control register and timer control
        register.
- clocks: Clock id for using watchdog timer.
- clock-frequency: Clock frequency for watchdog timer.
- interrupts: Interrupt # for watchdog kick timer(SMU timer)
- int-offset: SMU Watchdog timer interrupt bit offset in TIREQ register
- clear-bit: SMU Watchdog timer clear bit offset in TWDCLR register
- have-rstcnt-reg: Chipset that has reset counter register which released after
        TCC899x

Example:
        watchdog@74400008 {
                compatible = "telechips,wdt";
                reg = <0x144000D8 0x4>,  /* PMU_WDTCTRL */
                      <0x14300060 0x1C>, /* TIREQ */
                      <0x14300070 0xC>;  /* TWDCFG*/
                clocks = <&clk_peri PERI_TCX &clk_peri PERI_TCT>;
                clock-frequency = <366>; /* 24MHz / 65536 */
                interrupts = <GIC_SPI 0 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
                int-offset = <6>;
                clear-bit = <0>;
                status = "okay" | "disabled";
        };
